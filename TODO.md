# TODO — Feature Roadmap

## Drawing Tools

- [ ] **Ellipse/Circle tool** — drag to draw ellipses, hold Shift for perfect circles
- [ ] **Line tool** — straight lines from point A to B, hold Shift to snap to 45° angles
- [ ] **Arrow tool** — line with configurable arrowhead (one or both ends)
- [ ] **Text tool** — click to place text, editable inline, font size/family/color options
- [ ] **Polygon tool** — regular polygons (triangle, pentagon, hexagon, star) with configurable sides
- [ ] **Eyedropper tool** — sample color from any shape on the canvas

## Editing & Transform

- [ ] **Undo/Redo** — action history stack with Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z
- [ ] **Resize handles** — scale shapes via drag handles on the selection bounding box
- [ ] **Rotation handle** — rotate shapes via handle above the selection bounding box
- [ ] **Selection marquee** — drag on empty space with pointer tool to select shapes within a rectangle
- [ ] **Copy/Paste/Duplicate** — Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, Ctrl+D support for selected shapes
- [ ] **Delete with keyboard** — Delete/Backspace to remove selected shapes

## Shape Tools Improvements

- [ ] **Shift-constrain for rectangle** — hold Shift to draw perfect squares
- [ ] **Fill bucket tool** — click a shape to change its fill color to the active color

## Toolbar & UI

- [ ] **Add bezier tool to toolbar** — it's wired up in the service but missing from the toolbar
- [ ] **Keyboard shortcuts** — implement the shortcuts shown in tooltips (H, P, E, B, R, Z) and add new ones
- [ ] **Toolbar sub-menus** — group related shape tools (rect, ellipse, polygon) under one toolbar slot

## Quality of Life

- [ ] **Snap to grid** — optional grid overlay with shape snapping
- [ ] **Align tools** — align/distribute selected shapes (left, center, right, top, middle, bottom)
- [ ] **Z-order controls** — bring to front, send to back, move up/down for selected shapes
- [ ] **Export** — export canvas as PNG or SVG
